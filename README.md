- Hi, I’m @Ashrier
- I’m interested in robotics, automation, plant factories, permaculture, and sensor design.
- I have most of my coding experience in python but I have done a little matlab in octave and I have done some machine coding based on the design of NAND gates.
- I recieved my Bachelors in forestry from Clemson. I worked for ComEd as a Utility forester for 2 years. I am currently full time learning and doing projects.
I have finished the deeplearning specialisation on Courser.org I am currently working on nand2tetris.org building a computer class and doing the Modern robotics specialisation on
Coursera.org from Northwestern. I am also learning how to embed sensors into circuits from Coursera.org. I plan on putting all of this information together to help design and innovate new and efficient ways to practice forestry and agriculture.
-I’m looking to collaborate on applying machine learning and robotics to the field of agriculture and forestry.
- How to reach me. My email is ashrier0519@gmail.com!
