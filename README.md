- Hi, I’m @Ashrier
- I’m interested in robotics, mostly python programming ( I have done a TINY bit of matlab in octave), machine learning technique, agriculutre and forestry.
- I recieved my Bachelors in forestry from Clemson. I worked for ComEd as a Utility forester for 2 years. I am currently full time learning and doing projects.
I have finished the deeplearning specialisation on Courser.org I am currently working on nand2tetris.org building a computer class and doing the Modern robotics specialisation on
Coursera.org from Northwestern. I am also learning how to embed sensors into circuits from Coursera.org. I plan on putting all of this information together to help design and innovate
new and efficient ways to practice forestry and agriculture.
-I’m looking to collaborate on applying machine learning and robotics to the field of agriculture and forestry. Ehh why not, also horticulture.
- How to reach me. My email is ashrier0519@gmail.com!
